  If your organization is taking too long to launch, it may be due to an insufficient gas price. Your Ethereum provider <em>should</em> pre-fill the correct gas limit and gas price, but sometimes it will pre-fill the amounts too low. Below are the recommended actions you can take to evaluate whether this is the case:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you're paying a reasonable <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/" target="_blank">gas price</a>. Think of gas as a budget for the miner to process your transaction.</li>
  <li>You may also want to increase the gas limit, which will allow more transactions per second to be processed by the Ethereum blockchain. Learn more about gas limits <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/gas-limit/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li>If you're using MetaMask as your Ethereum provider, <a href="https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488771-How-to-Adjust-Gas-Price-and-Gas-Limit-" target="_blank">read here</a> on how you can adjust gas price and gas limits for your transactions.</li>
</ul>
